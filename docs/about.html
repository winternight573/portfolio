        <h1>Hi, I'm Winnie</h1>
        <p class="lead">I like to describe myself as <strong>interdisciplinary</strong>—someone who bridges the analytical and the emotional, the technical and the creative.</p>

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      
      <p>I hold a <strong>BS in Applied and Computational Math Sciences</strong> (Discrete Math and Algorithms) and a <strong>minor in Dance</strong> from the University of Washington. This unusual combination reflects my belief that rigorous investigation and visceral emotional expression aren't opposites—they're complementary ways of understanding the world.</p>

      <p>My perspective is also shaped by <strong>UX research and marketing</strong>, through both academic projects and internships. These experiences taught me to balance user needs with business constraints, and to communicate complex ideas clearly across disciplines.</p>

      <p>Currently, I'm a graduate student at <strong>Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center</strong>, where I'm becoming a technically fluent interactive experience designer—someone who can both envision creative possibilities and bring them to life through code, research, and collaboration.</p>

      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
      
      <p>I'm especially drawn to <strong>creative R&D projects</strong> that push boundaries: adaptive sound design that responds to player emotion, immersive experiences that blur the line between physical and digital, and tools that empower creators to tell better stories.</p>

      <p>What excites me most is the <strong>research phase</strong>—digging into hard problems, prototyping rapidly, playtesting relentlessly, and iterating until something clicks. I bring open-minded synthesis and collaborative communication to every team, helping bridge the gap between technical implementation and creative vision.</p>

      <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
      
      <p>When I'm not designing experiences or writing code, you might find me exploring movement and choreography, getting lost in interactive art installations, or thinking about how sound shapes emotional narrative.</p>
